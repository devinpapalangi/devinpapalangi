## üöÄ What I Do

I bring a versatile skill set to the world of tech, allowing me to contribute effectively in various domains. In front-end development, I'm proficient in Dart, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a strong focus on creating dynamic and user-friendly interfaces. My expertise extends to building feature-rich mobile and web applications using Flutter with Dart also and with TypeScript, ensuring a polished user experience.

On the back-end, I'm well-versed in three powerful frameworks: Express.js, Laravel 10, and Gin. Express.js, built on Node.js, enables me to craft efficient RESTful APIs and dynamic server-side applications. Laravel 10, a robust PHP framework, empowers me to develop scalable and sophisticated back-end systems. Gin, on the other hand, is a high-performance web framework for the Go programming language, known for its speed and efficiency. It's an excellent choice for building fast and reliable APIs and web applications in Go.

As for my projects, you can explore my GitHub repositories to see my work in action. Notably, I've developed:

1. **Instagram Clone (Flutter):** This mobile app project showcases my skills in cross-platform app development and UI design. You can find the project [here](https://github.com/devinpapalangi/instagram-clone).

2. **Amazon Clone (Flutter):** Another mobile app project, I've built the "Amazon Clone" using Flutter, highlighting my expertise in cross-platform app development and polished UI design. You can explore the project [here](https://github.com/devinpapalangi/amazon-clone).

Both of these projects are available on my GitHub repositories for review and are representative of my capabilities.

Additionally, during my internship at PT Artha Graha Internasional Tbk, I worked on two web projects:
1. **Contract Web Manager:** This website was created to store and manage contracts data for the Digital Banking Directorate. It was developed using React and Laravel.
2. **Testing Solution Website:** This website was designed to store and manage project data for testing. It was developed using React with Typescript and Gin.It tracks project progress and status and is used by the Testing Solution Team.

Unfortunately, I can't share these web projects due to company restrictions.

My commitment to staying updated with the latest technologies drives me to continuously explore new frameworks and tools. Whether it's enhancing user experiences, streamlining server-side operations, or working on data-related projects, I'm dedicated to delivering innovative solutions for the digital world.

Please feel free to explore these projects on my GitHub profile, and don't hesitate to reach out for collaboration or to discuss any of these endeavors further. Your feedback and contributions are always appreciated!
## üåü Future Improvements
While I'm proud of the work I've accomplished so far, I believe that there's always room for improvement and growth. Here are some exciting areas I plan to explore and enhance in the future:
- Software Development Methodologies
- Native Application Development (Android and iOS)
- Testing and Quality Assurance
- Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
- Documentation

My primary focus on methodologies stems from the desire to understand the architectural and procedural aspects of software development. While technical skills are crucial, a solid grasp of methodologies enhances my ability to plan, execute, and deliver projects efficiently. It represents my commitment to becoming a well-rounded developer who not only codes but also comprehends the intricate process that turns code into meaningful appli
