## 🚀 What I Do

I bring a versatile skill set to the world of tech, allowing me to contribute effectively in various domains. In front-end development, I'm proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a strong focus on creating dynamic and user-friendly interfaces. My expertise extends to building feature-rich web applications using React with TypeScript, ensuring a polished user experience.

On the back-end, I'm well-versed in two powerful frameworks: Express.js and Laravel 10. Express.js, built on Node.js, enables me to craft efficient RESTful APIs and dynamic server-side applications, while Laravel 10, a robust PHP framework, empowers me to develop scalable and sophisticated back-end systems.

While my data engineering experience is relatively brief, I've had hands-on exposure to Python and SQL, particularly in the realms of ETL processes and task automation. I've also ventured into bot development, including Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications.

As for my projects, you can explore my GitHub repositories to see my work in action. Notably, I've developed:

Mattermost Errbot Agi: This project showcases my expertise in chatbot development and integration with Mattermost. It's a testament to my ability to create conversational interfaces and automate tasks.

Contract Web Manager: In the realm of full-stack web development, I've created the "Contract Web Manager" project. It demonstrates my proficiency in end-to-end web application development and management.

Amazon Clone (Flutter): For mobile app development, I've built the "Amazon Clone" using Flutter. It highlights my skills in cross-platform app development and UI design.

My commitment to staying updated with the latest technologies drives me to continuously explore new frameworks and tools. Whether it's enhancing user experiences, streamlining server-side operations, or working on data-related projects, I'm dedicated to delivering innovative solutions for the digital world.
